by Lynn K.A. Sörensen, Heleen A. Slagter, Sander M. Bohté, & H. Steven Scholte

###Overview
This is the code that accompagnies this [paper]() and consists of three parts:

* the `asn` package for DCNNs for obtaining the ASN transfer function and the global gain modulation.
* the code to reproduce the results in the paper (`ModelPerformance`, `ModelAnalysis`)
* the code to reproduce the paper figures (`Figures`)


### Dependencies

Implementation for Keras (2.2.4) with a tensorflow backend (1.10).

All result files can be downloaded [here](). Please make sure to add the files to folder `Results` to reproduce the Figures.

The weights of the base models trained on ImageNet can be accessed here[here](https://uvaauas.figshare.com/projects/Leveraging_spiking_deep_neural_networks_to_understand_neural_mechanisms_underlying_selective_attention/94406).
